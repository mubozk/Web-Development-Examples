<h1>Best Movies to My Liking</h1>
<h2>My Top 3 Movies</h2>
<hr/>
<h3>Interstellar</h3>
<p>My all time favorite. It is about when Earth becomes uninhabitable in the future, a farmer and ex-NASA pilot, Joseph Cooper, is tasked to pilot a spacecraft, along with a team of researchers, to find a new planet for humans.</p>
<h3>The Matrix</h3>
<p>When a beautiful stranger leads computer hacker Neo to a forbidding underworld, he discovers the shocking truth--the life he knows is the elaborate deception of an evil cyber-intelligence.</p>
<h3>The Batman (2022)</h3>
<p>Even though I like Nolan's Batman series this movie got my liking because it's about the time when Batman was not professional enough we see his mistakes as well he's not perfect. The movie itself is about when a sadistic serial killer begins murdering key political figures in Gotham, Batman is forced to investigate the city's hidden corruption and question his family's involvement.</p>
